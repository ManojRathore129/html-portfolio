<p>I love movies, I have watched tons of all kinds of movies. I play guitar, piano and I sing quite good. 
  For me friends and family are everything, I genuinly love and care about them, I am always free for them 
  whenever they need me. I love acting and dancing, and even I have won a lot of medals for dancing and music.
  Earlier I wanted to be an actor but my parents didn't support me in this field as they said that there is lot of
  struggle in acting field, so I quit and starting studying web development and here I am.</p>
